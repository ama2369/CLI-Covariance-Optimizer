# CLI Covariance Portfolio Optimizer

In portfolio optimization, the covariance matrix of asset returns is a key input. One can calculate this matrix using historical return data. The covariance matrix is essential for assessing the relationship between assets and for constructing efficient portfolios. In this repository, we develop a CLI to calculate the covariance matrix and optimize portfolios for a custom set of stocks.
